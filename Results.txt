RNA Seq:
RT-PCR: Cortex samples positive for Megalin and Nos; medulla samples positive for Urea Transporter

All samples positive for ÃŸ Actin

Genes indicative of kidney injury increased in HF samples: Lipocalin, fibronectin, KIM-1; NO increase in Collagen IV



~Other results~
Males fed HF diet weighed >> than ctrl diet(1A), had elevated non-fasting blood glucose levels as compared to controls (1B)

Diet-matched female mice didn't gain weight

Weight-matched females gained weight (1A)

Neither group of females had elevated non-fasting glucose levels (1B)

Fasting glucose levels in males elevated when compared to age matched controls (1C)

HF males: Impaired glucose tolerance compared to control males (1C&D) & increased glomerular filtration rate (1E)

NO differences between groups in urinary protein or gluocose concentration

Kidney weight to body weight ratios: No change between 2 croups

Histological studies: Trend towards enlarged glmeruli in HF samples (2A-C)

Trend towards increased glomerular collagen (2D-F)

Nothing significant for Collagen IV between two groups
